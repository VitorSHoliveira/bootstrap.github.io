                    <p>Vitor Oliveira was born on the 28 of April, 1986 in Teresópolis, state of Rio de Janeiro–Brazil.
                        Vitor started training jiu-jitsu when he was 8 years old at the famous Pitbull academy,
                        influenced by his father who already practiced the martial art.

                        Adilson de Lima, also known as professor “Bitta” was Vitor Henrique’s first coach and the man
                        that graduated Vitor in all his jiu-jitsu belts, including his black belt which happened when
                        Vitor was 22 years old. Since receiving his black belt, Henrique became a team member for
                        GFTeam.
                    </p>

                    <p>Vitor Henrique Oliveira, also known as “Vitinho” is a jiu jitsu black belt and a representative
                        of the well respected GF Team academy (formerly of Pit-bull Jiu Jitsu). Vitor Henrique made
                        himself noticed to the mainstream grappling community through his aggressive style of competing,
                        a style that he used in of the best matches of the 2012 world championships (against Bill
                        Cooper). Oliveira has also placed in important competitions such as the IBJJF World
                        Championship, World Cup (CBJJO), the Brasileiro ( IBJJF Brazilian nationals), American nationals
                        and Rio International Open.
